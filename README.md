# -IoT-Based-Pounder

The IoT Based Pounder is a seesaw lever model used for pounding or crushing any desired product.

The prototype is designed with Mechanism where two buckets attached to its ends along with a pounder. 
In the beginning, One of the buckets is filled with water, which causes the seesaw to tip in its direction. 
Accelerometer connected in the prototype causes the bucket filled with water to start pumping water on the opposite end. 
Water flows from the filled bucket into the empty bucket as the seesaw continues to tip, 
sensors in the prototype will continue to detect change in the position of the seesaw and the pump to make water ascend and descend. 
This phenomenon is repeated constantly and helps to maintain the balance of the seesaw. Hammers are placed at the bottom of each bucket, 
such that when the bucket is filled with water, it falls in full force with gravity and the material below will be smashed.

With the IoT Based Pounder model, which uses the seesaw mechanism and IoT technology, this project saves human efforts and works with minimum energy making it energy-efficient.
