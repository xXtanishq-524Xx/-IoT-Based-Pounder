# -IoT-Based-Pounder

The IoT Based Pounder is a seesaw lever model used for pounding or crushing any desired product.

The prototype is designed with Mechanism where two buckets attached to its ends along with a pounder. 
In the beginning, One of the buckets is filled with water, which causes the seesaw to tip in its direction. 
Accelerometer connected in the prototype causes the bucket filled with water to start pumping water on the opposite end. 
Water flows from the filled bucket into the empty bucket as the seesaw continues to tip, 
sensors in the prototype will continue to detect change in the position of the seesaw and the pump to make water ascend and descend. 
This phenomenon is repeated constantly and helps to maintain the balance of the seesaw. Hammers are placed at the bottom of each bucket, 
such that when the bucket is filled with water, it falls in full force with gravity and the material below will be smashed.

With the IoT Based Pounder model, which uses the seesaw mechanism and IoT technology, this project saves human efforts and works with minimum energy making it energy-efficient.

Advantage:

The IoT based pounding machines can crush things in a very effective way, thanks to their advanced technology. By leveraging sensors and analytics, 
the machines can optimise the crushing process, delivering consistent and high-quality results. This efficiency can help to save time, money, and 
resources, making it a valuable investment for various industries.

The IoT technology used in the machine allows for remote control from anywhere in the world, making it a convenient and user-friendly option. 
This feature enables users to monitor and control the pounding process from their fingertips, ensuring that the process is running smoothly 
and without interruption.

The energy efficiency of the IoT-based pounding machines is significantly higher than traditional pounding machines. This higher efficiency means that 
the machines consume less energy, resulting in a lower cost of operation. This cost-effectiveness can help to save money in the long run, making it an 
attractive option for businesses and individuals alike.

The IoT-based pounding machines can be customised to meet specific needs and requirements. With advanced analytics and sensors, the machines can be 
adjusted to optimise performance and efficiency for specific applications. This customization can help to improve the quality and consistency of the 
pounding process, resulting in better overall outcomes.
